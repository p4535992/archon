## Archon

## Features
* Create an "archon" item by combining a source item with a template item.  The template item can either the system's default item or an existing one.
  * Mixed types for source and template items are supported. E.g. hide a glider item of type "equipment" inside a backpack item of type "container" to represent unfolding the glider apparatus from its carrier.
  * Drag and drop items onto either Archon "A" to quickly assign by UUID.  Alternatively, enter any valid UUID in the noted input fields.
* Can opt to store the source item only as its UUID (default) or as its serialized data. The latter allows for transfer of archons between worlds, at the cost of increased data usage.
* List all token actors on the current scene who are holding archons and individually inspect both the currently held version as well as its true form.
* Reveal an archon's true form.
